                                    Stay away from those people who try to
                                    disparage your ambitions. Small minds will
                                    always do that, but great minds will give
                                    you a feeling that you can become great too.

                                Teamwork is the ability to work together toward
                                a common vision. The ability to direct
                                individual accomplishments toward organizational
                                objectives. It is the fuel that allows common
                                people to attain uncommon results. Individual
                                commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes
